# Chimera II Crypto Upstreams and Provenance

**Status:** research/provenance catalogue — 2026-09-10

This document records public standards and open-source implementations reviewed for the Chimera II cryptocurrency interoperability layer. It is a reference and provenance record, not a claim that third-party projects are part of Chimera II or that their source has been copied.

## Design boundary

Chimera II crypto tooling supports legitimate cryptographic operations on material already possessed by the operator:

- private-key -> public-key -> address derivation;
- Bitcoin and Ethereum address syntax/checksum validation;
- BIP-32/BIP-39/BIP-44 deterministic derivation from legitimately possessed seed/key material;
- deterministic published test vectors;
- cryptographic benchmarking on synthetic/test data;
- ISA/emulator experiments for hashing, elliptic-curve and wide-integer operations.

It does **not** implement or restore public-address -> private-key search, guessing, inference, wallet targeting, or brute-force recovery.

## Standards and primary specifications

| Reference | Relevance | Chimera use |
|---|---|---|
| [BIP-32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) | Hierarchical deterministic key derivation over secp256k1 | Conformance/test-vector reference |
| [ERC-55 / EIP-55](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-55) | Ethereum mixed-case address checksum | Address validation/encoding reference |
| [ERC-1191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1191) | Optional chain-ID-aware Ethereum checksum | Network-aware validation research |

BIP-32 specifies secp256k1 point multiplication, serialization and extended-key derivation. The specification also publishes deterministic test vectors. ERC-55 specifies Keccak-256-based mixed-case checksum encoding. ERC-1191 extends the checksum scheme for selected chain IDs.

The listed projects are independent projects. Chimera II does not imply endorsement, affiliation, authorship, or ownership.

## GitLab findings requiring caution

GitLab topic discovery also surfaces projects explicitly focused on private-key recovery, public-key cracking, address puzzles, vanity searching, or wallet sweeping. Those projects are useful only as security/threat-model references for this catalogue; their key-recovery/search functionality is **not** imported into Chimera II crypto repositories.

## License/provenance rules

1. Prefer standards-compatible independent implementations when a clean-room implementation is sufficient.
2. If third-party source is incorporated, retain the upstream copyright and license notices and record the exact upstream project, version/commit, files, and modifications.
3. Do not copy source merely because it is publicly visible.
4. Do not vendor proprietary, confidential, credential-bearing, or undocumented material.
5. Dependencies retain their own licenses; the Chimera II root GPL license does not relicense third-party components.
6. License metadata from Git hosting is a useful signal but is not legal advice. A repository's dependencies and embedded assets require separate review.

## GitHub and GitLab discovery

GitHub repository/code search and GitLab blob/topic search were used to discover comparable public implementations. GitLab's API documents `scope=blobs` for filename/content search and its semantic search facilities; GitHub documents repository and license metadata APIs. These facilities are discovery mechanisms, not permission to copy code.

- GitHub repository API: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos
- GitHub license API: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/licenses/licenses
- GitLab search API: https://docs.gitlab.com/api/search/
- GitLab BIP-32 topic: https://gitlab.com/explore/projects/topics/bip32
- GitLab secp256k1 topic: https://gitlab.com/explore/projects/topics/secp256k1

## Security and testing policy

Crypto changes should include:

- published deterministic test vectors;
- malformed-input tests;
- checksum negative tests;
- cross-implementation comparison tests;
- fuzz/property tests where practical;
- constant-time/security-sensitive primitive review;
- dependency/license/SBOM review;
- secret-material redaction and no-secret logging;
- reproducible build information where available.

## Chimera II ISA mapping

Suitable primitives can be mapped into the C8192/R8192 research ISA without changing the wallet safety boundary:

- wide integer add/subtract/compare;
- modular reduction and multiplication;
- SHA-2/SHA-3/Keccak hashing;
- secp256k1 point operations through explicitly defined accelerator contracts;
- deterministic HMAC/PBKDF2-style derivation;
- serialization/base encoding;
- vector/tensor operations for benchmark workloads.

The ISA specification must distinguish architectural instructions from library-level operations and must provide deterministic conformance vectors before claiming parity.

## Search snapshot

This catalogue was expanded on 2026-09-10 using current public GitHub/GitLab documentation and current public repositories. Re-run the discovery process before adopting a dependency, because repositories, licenses, releases, and security status can change.
