# Universal CPU Toolchains

Chimera II OS exposes a capability registry for assemblers, disassemblers, compilers, linkers, object utilities, debuggers and CPU emulators.

The open-toolchain baseline is GNU Binutils/GAS/objdump, GCC, LLVM MC/Clang/LLD and QEMU. NASM/YASM are registered for x86 families. Microsoft MASM/MSVC and vendor compiler families are represented as external adapters because their binaries and licenses are not redistributed by Chimera.

A toolchain entry identifies supported CPU targets, tool kinds, detection commands, license class and redistribution policy. Detection is capability discovery: an absent tool is not a build failure unless a selected build profile requires it.

The registry deliberately does not claim that every historical CPU instruction is implemented in Chimera. Native C8192/R8192 execution remains distinct from foreign-ISA translation/emulation/import. Tool output is consumed through the universal ISA and canonical micro-op boundaries.

ISO-Tool stages the registry and provenance metadata; it does not silently package proprietary compiler or assembler binaries.

## Native compiler/linker implementation

Chimera II OS now ships an integration layer for the native open toolchain:

- `chimera-cc`: C compiler driver using GCC by default or Clang with `CHIMERA_NATIVE_COMPILER=clang`.
- `chimera-cxx`: C++ compiler driver using G++ by default or Clang++.
- `chimera-gas`: GNU as/LLVM MC/NASM selection through `CHIMERA_ASSEMBLER`.
- `chimera-ld`: GNU BFD ld or LLVM LLD selection through `CHIMERA_NATIVE_LINKER`.
- `chimera-as`: the existing Chimera ISA assembler, intentionally kept separate from GNU as.

The drivers do not replace GCC, LLVM, Binutils or NASM. They establish a stable Chimera SDK command contract and preserve the upstream licensing of each underlying component. GCC documents the normal C/C++ compilation pipeline and Binutils supplies the assembler/linker/object-tool layer; Clang documents the same compiler-to-assembler/linker pipeline and LLD is available as an LLVM linker. citeturn0search0turn0search2turn1search12

Native mode produces host-native executables. Cross compilation is selected explicitly with a target compiler/sysroot; it is not a claim that physical x86-64, AArch64 or RISC-V processors contain Chimera's virtual RegisterN-wide registers.
