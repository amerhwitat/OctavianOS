# Terminal banner design and integration

Two complementary directions are retained: (1) the detailed terminal-dashboard treatment used by the portable banner script, and (2) this wide glass/aurora identity artwork for documentation and desktop previews.

## Artwork
- `assets/terminal/octavian-terminal-banner.svg`: standalone, dependency-free SVG artwork.
- The banner script is a user-invoked preview; it is not automatically sourced by login shells and does not change startup behavior.

## Preview
Open the SVG in a browser or image viewer. Run `sh tools/octavian-terminal-banner.sh` for the text-only terminal treatment.

## Catalog semantics
The terminal/shell catalog is a curated list, not an exhaustive universe of open-source projects. `provider-required` means the program/package is not thereby installed or implemented in this OS. Verify upstream licensing, package availability, and runtime integration before advertising it as native.
