# Production userspace handoff — acceptance and integration contract

**Status: BLOCKED.** Latest inspected native production acceptance run: [OctavianOS workflow #317](https://github.com/amerhwitat/OctavianOS/actions/runs/39191187931), commit `41d0315e7fbba8469d3b76ce13ad67b817ef7041`. The Koronos build and ISO-candidate artifact jobs completed successfully, but the unchanged real-userspace verifier failed for Live, Installer, and Recovery: each trace lacks a user-originated CPL 3 init syscall acknowledgement and a subsequent readiness marker carrying the same real PID. The prerelease job was skipped as intended. Source-integration CI passed, but it is not production acceptance evidence. OctavianOS PR #68 remains draft and unmerged.

The separate [ChimeraIIOS PR #125](https://github.com/amerhwitat/ChimeraIIOS/pull/125) includes a ring-3 probe/launch candidate and new timeout work; its standalone probe ISO is not evidence that OctavianOS extracts the real init executable from each production payload, routes it by the selected target, and launches it from the final ISO. Do not blindly copy it over the OctavianOS-specific path or treat kernel-authored output as proof. The production handoff remains blocked.

## What the evidence means

The acceptance job ran the existing verifier unchanged against these traces:

- `trace/full-iso-debugcon.log` for Live
- `trace/installer-debugcon.log` for Installer
- `trace/recovery-debugcon.log` for Recovery

All three failed because they lack both a user-originated init syscall acknowledgement proving CPL 3 and a subsequent target-specific readiness marker carrying the same real, nonzero init PID. The verifier is intentionally fail-closed; do not weaken it or manufacture these markers from kernel code.

## Source-level integration gaps

The current vendored path and the upstream candidate must be treated as separate layers:

1. `process_loader.cpp` validates ELF load segments and maps/initializes memory through callbacks; this alone does not schedule or enter the image.
2. `process.cpp` records ELF metadata/PID admission. Admission is not proof that an instruction executed in ring 3.
3. `interrupt.cpp` installs DPL-0 IDT gates and explicitly defers ring-3 exposure until TSS, stack, and address-space setup are complete.
4. The compatibility `syscall.cpp` dispatcher is not itself a hardware syscall entry/return path; its current GETPID/EXIT semantics are insufficient evidence of process-owned PID and teardown.
5. Multiboot module classification recognizes a possible `CHIMERA_MODULE_USER_INIT_ELF`, but classification is not proof that the ISO build actually stages the target's production init ELF or that the launch path selects it.
6. The current QEMU smoke gates prove kernel readiness and target routing only. They must not be renamed or documented as production userspace acceptance.

Upstream [ChimeraIIOS PR #125](https://github.com/amerhwitat/ChimeraIIOS/pull/125) contains a candidate ring-3 probe path and passed its standalone acceptance workflow. It does **not** by itself prove that the real init executable is extracted from the production Live/Installer/Recovery payload and launched in the final ISO. Do not blindly copy it over OctavianOS-specific source.

## Required implementation sequence

1. **Define the production payload contract.** For each target, establish how the actual init executable is identified and extracted from its initramfs/rootfs. Validate archive paths, ELF header/machine/type, PT_LOAD bounds, integer overflow, BSS, entry-point-in-executable-segment, and resource limits. Reject ambiguous/multiple targets.
2. **Stage and route the selected init.** Make the ISO build produce the module or other explicit handoff object consumed by Koronos. Validate the module's identity and target against the selected GRUB/Jasper entry. Do not fall back from Installer or Recovery to Live.
3. **Create an isolated process address space.** Verify process-owned CR3 and page-table lifetime, preserved required kernel mappings, user/supervisor permission bits, non-executable data/stack, W^X, guard pages, and cleanup on every failed load.
4. **Install privilege-transition state.** Verify GDT user descriptors, 64-bit TSS descriptor and `ltr`, valid RSP0 kernel stack, canonical user entry/stack addresses, and a long-mode ring-3 trampoline. Keep interrupts disabled until entry/return invariants are safe.
5. **Implement the real syscall boundary.** Verify MSR setup or an explicitly designed interrupt gate, register/stack ABI, user-origin/CPL validation, safe return state, real per-process GETPID, and EXIT/EXIT_GROUP teardown. Do not use a constant PID or semantic dispatcher as evidence of a hardware syscall.
6. **Emit evidence from the right origin.** The acknowledgement must be emitted only after the syscall entry path proves the caller was at CPL 3. Readiness must be emitted by the running target init after that acknowledgement and carry the same real nonzero PID. Kernel-authored imitation markers are forbidden.
7. **Run the six production cases.** Live, Installer, and Recovery under BIOS and UEFI, with separate trace artifacts and the existing verifier unchanged. Test successful user execution and negative cases (missing module, wrong target, malformed ELF, bad mapping, and init exit before handshake).
8. **Verify the full handoff.** After Live init readiness, prove Aurora/compositor startup. Verify installer completion and booting the installed target, plus a meaningful Recovery action. Test AP startup/per-CPU scheduling separately before making SMP claims.
9. **Gate releases.** The prerelease job must depend on all six production cases and the Aurora/installer/recovery follow-up gates. Any missing trace or verifier failure blocks publication.

## Acceptance matrix

| Production case | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Live / BIOS | NOT VERIFIED — current aggregate Live trace fails |
| Installer / BIOS | NOT VERIFIED — current Installer trace fails |
| Recovery / BIOS | NOT VERIFIED — current Recovery trace fails |
| Live / UEFI | NOT VERIFIED |
| Installer / UEFI | NOT VERIFIED |
| Recovery / UEFI | NOT VERIFIED |
| Aurora after actual Live init | NOT VERIFIED |
| Installer completion + installed boot | NOT VERIFIED |
| Recovery action | NOT VERIFIED |
| Production release | BLOCKED |

The existing aggregate run demonstrates that all three target traces fail; it does not establish six independent BIOS/UEFI outcomes. Record each case separately once the workflow runs them separately.

## Completion evidence

A source change is not complete until CI demonstrates: successful native build; ELF/module contract tests; production payload extraction tests; six target/firmware QEMU runs; verifier PASS for every trace without modifying the verifier; preserved debug traces; and Aurora/installer/recovery follow-up evidence. Until then, report the gate as BLOCKED rather than inferring success from a kernel-ready marker.
